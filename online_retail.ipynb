    "\n",
    "1. **Load the data** into a Pandas DataFrame and inspect the first few rows.  \n",
    "2. **Clean the dataset** by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.  \n",
    "3. **Explore basic statistics** to understand distributions and trends.  \n",
    "4. **Visualize the data** using plots such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.  \n",
    "5. **Analyze sales trends** over time to identify peak sales periods.  \n",
    "6. **Identify top-selling products and countries** based on quantity sold.  \n",
    "7. **Detect anomalies or outliers** that may impact the analysis.  \n",
    "8. **Summarize key findings** and insights from the data.  \n",
