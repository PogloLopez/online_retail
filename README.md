# Online Retail Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores an **online retail transactions dataset**, focusing on **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving business insights**. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including invoice details, product descriptions, quantities, prices, and customer IDs.

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§  
This project is still under development. Key steps such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier detection are being implemented before moving into analysis and visualization.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.
- **Business Insights**: Extract meaningful insights to support decision-making.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Public dataset from an **online retail store**.
- **Size**: ~540K rows, 8 columns.
- **Key Columns**:
  - `InvoiceNo`: Transaction ID
  - `StockCode`: Product identifier
  - `Description`: Product name
  - `Quantity`: Number of units purchased
  - `InvoiceDate`: Date of purchase
  - `UnitPrice`: Price per unit
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for customers
  - `Country`: Country of purchase

## Current Progress
### âœ… Data Cleaning Steps Implemented
- **Handled missing values** in `Description` and `CustomerID`.
- **Converted categorical variables** to appropriate data types.
- **Cleaned text data** (trimmed spaces, standardized casing, etc.).
- **Identified and removed duplicates** while preserving meaningful transaction data.
- **Handled negative values and outliers** in `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
- Create **visualizations** to enhance data interpretation.
- Build a **dashboard or report** for insights presentation.
- Apply **statistical or machine learning models** for deeper analysis (optional).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization (planned)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-retail-analysis.git
   cd online-retail-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Customer segmentation analysis.
- Predictive modeling for sales trends.
- Interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau.
