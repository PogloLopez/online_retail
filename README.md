## üìä Key Sections

### 1. **Sales Performance Overview**
- The **United Kingdom** dominates in both revenue and volume.
- The product **REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER** generated the most revenue; **PAPER CRAFT, LITTLE BIRDIE** had the highest sales volume.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: \$478.26
- A small number of high-value customers are responsible for a large portion of revenue, highlighting opportunities for retention strategies.

### 2. **Customer Behavior and RFM Analysis**
- Customers were segmented using **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** (RFM) metrics.
- High RFM scores revealed loyal and valuable customers for personalized engagement.
- Behavioral patterns were visualized through RFM segmentation and distribution plots.

### 3. **Product Return Analysis**
- Return rate per country was calculated **as a proportion of total sales**, allowing fair comparisons across different sales volumes.
- The **UK**, while having the highest return volume, showed a return rate of **~9.3%**, which is moderate given its sales size.
- Several top-selling products like **PAPER CRAFT, LITTLE BIRDIE** and **MEDIUM CERAMIC TOP STORAGE JAR** had **return rates exceeding 90%**, indicating potential product issues or misalignment with customer expectations.
